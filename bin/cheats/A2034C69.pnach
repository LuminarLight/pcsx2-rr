gametitle=Jak II [Demo] - (U)(SCUS-97273)
comment=Enables Developer/Debug Mode - Credit to water111 and Vaser for discovering / documenting the required ELF edits for the Jak 2 Demo. 
comment=Thanks to Luminar Light for patching and documenting the required level loading patches.
comment=When the game boots, you will see a "work in progress" splash screen, followed by a black screen. The game is running in the background. 
comment=When the screen is black, press L3 + Select, D-Pad Down, and then press X. Then, use the continue feature from the debug menu to "escape" the missing fortress level.

// This is about changing the stack pointer
// Shoves a MIPS instruction into near the very top of the entry point
// Ghidra blows up here, but binary ninja can handle it
// Orginally at this position there is `2D E8 40 00` - `daddu $sp, $v0, $zero`
// This changes it to - `lui sp, 0x0800` Which loads the value 0x0800 to the stackpointer register, modifying it.

// This changes the DebugBootMessage from `demo` to `play`.
patch=0,EE,00126e10,word,79616c70

// This solves an issue caused by changing the DebugBootMessage
// The level loading system is patched to load `demo` and `demo-vis` instead of `fea` and `forexita-vis`.
// By doing this, you avoid a softlock at the start of the game
